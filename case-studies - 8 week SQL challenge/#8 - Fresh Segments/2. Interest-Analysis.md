## Case Study Questions - Interest Analysis


1. Which interests have been present in all month_year dates in our dataset?

2. Using this same total_months measure - calculate the cumulative percentage of all records starting at 14 months - which total_months value passes the 90% cumulative percentage value?

3. If we were to remove all interest_id values which are lower than the total_months value we found in the previous question - how many total data points would we be removing?

4. Does this decision make sense to remove these data points from a business perspective? Use an example where there are all 14 months present to a removed interest example for your arguments - think about what it means to have less months present from a segment perspective.

5. After removing these interests - how many unique interests are there for each month?
